# Coursera-Specializations-Minimizer
Minimizes that annoying specializations blocks in Coursera's main page.

## How to install

I haven't uploaded this extension to Chrome Web Store, so the easiest thing at the moment would be:

1. `git clone https://github.com/OrBin/Coursera-Specializations-Minimizer.git`
2. Open `chrome://extensions`.
3. Check the box "Developer mode" if not checked.
4. "Load unpacked extension..." the `Coursera-Specializations-Minimizer` folder.
